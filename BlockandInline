Blocks - can't put stuff beside it (div,header,etc)
inline - can put stuff beside it (text, img, link)

div { # once you change block -> inline, you can't have height and width
        display: inline;
        background-color: black;
        height: 150px;
        width: 150px;
      }

Blocks - margin, padding, border
collapsing margin - when two blocks have the same border then their margin joins together (only top bottom)
